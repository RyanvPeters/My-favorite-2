        <p>Dancing is my hobby. These days many people irrespective of their age do dancing. While dancing all you need are comfortable shoes and clothes. For instance, you cannot dance ballet wearing loose shoes.

            Similarly all kinds of clothes do not match the dance style. For instance, dancing ballet wearing loose clothes will give you a strange look

            The reason behind my dancing is my parents. They are a great source of inspiration for me. They dance with me so that I can dance and take my hobby forward. I never dance in the same style but I like to mix up everything. I know many types of dancing such as Jaz, tap, modern, hip hop, swing and western.

            Each type of dance has its own way of moving and rhythm. One has to feel the rhythm & learn the style of dance. I dance because it is the best way to be healthy and keep myself fit. Dance makes me feel relax & happy..</p>
